Step-by-step procedure.

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env                 # now u can see env folder in PWD
env\Scripts\activate           # to activate env(simply type env\Scripts\deactivate to deact it)

pip install django
django-admin startproject opinionorbit
cd opinionorbit
python manage.py runserver    # and that's our Django server started

We can store our environment in different ways. I am keeping it in the opinionorbit folder.

python manage.py startapp base
we need to let know this project about this app so add into INSTALLED_APPS in setting.py
    -> we can simpaly add 'base' but we liked to do direct path to the config file - 'base.apps.BaseConfig' , so now Django knows about our app

in urls.py '' means base page like starting page

after creating a seperate urls.py file for base app we have to connect it through the main urls.py to work it properly,
    so instead of adding all files there we can use include if it match go to this file like, path('', include('base.urls'))
    so it take care of all urls

now we creating a templates folder where we are going to store all the templates, and there are few ways to config it
    so, django doesn' know yet of templates dir, go to settings.py and we need to go in TEMPLATES -> 'DIRS' -> BASE_DIR / 'templates'

now we can get rid of HttpResponse and add html file path to it by using render methods

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/templates/
we are using template inheritance (for ex. we need navbar in every page and we don't want to write in every html)
    {% include 'navbar.html' %} - templating system/context

    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}          -> writing this in main so we can wrap around the other content,
                               so what that do is instead of including navbar to every page we can add it to the main
                               and we are gonna extend it {% extends 'main.html' %}

we can pass dict from views in html so now we have access that list in the particular html 

we created templates dir for all the templates inside our application, now for ex. we have bigger app than we need 
    template for individual app and we can have main & navbar as global so stays in base template but for others like
    room, home we can place them in our base app, and django follow some rulw for make that dir like -> inside app -> templates/_appName_
    and add base/ in views to run it properly
