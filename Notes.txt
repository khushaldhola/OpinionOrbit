Step-by-step procedure.

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env                 # now u can see env folder in PWD
env\Scripts\activate           # to activate env(simply type env\Scripts\deactivate to deact it)

pip install django
django-admin startproject opinionorbit
cd opinionorbit
python manage.py runserver    # and that's our Django server started

We can store our environment in different ways. I am keeping it in the opinionorbit folder.
