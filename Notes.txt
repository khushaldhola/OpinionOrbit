Step-by-step procedure.

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env                 # now u can see env folder in PWD
env\Scripts\activate           # to activate env(simply type env\Scripts\deactivate to deact it)

pip install django
django-admin startproject opinionorbit
cd opinionorbit
python manage.py runserver    # and that's our Django server started

We can store our environment in different ways. I am keeping it in the opinionorbit folder.

python manage.py startapp base
we need to let know this project about this app so add into INSTALLED_APPS in setting.py
    -> we can simpaly add 'base' but we liked to do direct path to the config file - 'base.apps.BaseConfig' , so now Django knows about our app

in urls.py '' means base page like starting page

after creating a seperate urls.py file for base app we have to connect it through the main urls.py to work it properly,
    so instead of adding all files there we can use include if it match go to this file like, path('', include('base.urls'))
    so it take care of all urls

now we creating a templates folder where we are going to store all the templates, and there are few ways to config it
    so, django doesn' know yet of templates dir, go to settings.py and we need to go in TEMPLATES -> 'DIRS' -> BASE_DIR / 'templates'

now we can get rid of HttpResponse and add html file path to it by using render methods
